# ImperialStudio.Core
Contains core features for Trojaner's Unity projects.

Some features include:
* ENet based networking with an authorative server (might add P2P for voice chat etc)
* IoC container for services
* A Unity project/library that actually uses modern C# with lots of OOP, patterns, etc.
